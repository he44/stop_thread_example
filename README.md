# stop_thread_example

This is a toy project to demonstrate a user-stoppable worker thread in C++. The implementation took help from Chat-GPT and Github Copilot.

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run

```bash
cd build
./stop_thread_example
```

## How to verify the number of threads

I didn't get the `htop` to correctly show threads on my M1 Mac. So I ended up using `ps -M <pid>`.

By using `man ps`, we can see:

`-M      Print the threads corresponding to each task.`

After the worker thread was started:

```bash
PID   TT   %CPU STAT PRI     STIME     UTIME COMMAND
<pid> s000    0.0 S    31T   0:00.00   0:00.00 ./stop_thread_example
<pid>         0.0 S    31T   0:00.00   0:00.00 
```

After the worker thread was stopped:

```bash
PID   TT   %CPU STAT PRI     STIME     UTIME COMMAND
<pid> s000    0.0 S    31T   0:00.00   0:00.00 ./stop_thread_example

```
